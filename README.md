This repository contains the code and analysis workflows used in the paper:

***A Mechanistic, Threshold-Free Framework for Inferring Superspreading Molecular Transmission Clusters***

The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for inferring recent transmission and identifying superspreading molecular transmission clusters (SMTCs) from pathogen genomic data and sampling dates, without relying on fixed genetic or temporal thresholds.

The methodological framework itself is implemented in the companion tool **[epilink](https://github.com/ydnkka/epilink)**. This repository is dedicated to the reproducibility of the results presented in the paper and includes scripts for data generation, analysis, benchmarking, and figure reproduction.

The repository supports:

* Simulation of epidemiological and genomic data along known transmission trees
* Application of the mechanistic, threshold-free inference framework via *epilink*
* Network construction and community detection analyses
* Evaluation of inferred clusters using BCubed metrics
* Sensitivity analyses for incubation period assumptions and molecular clock rates
* Benchmarking against logistic regression baselines
* Reproduction of all figures and tables in the main text and supplementary material

This repository is intended for transparency and reproducibility and is not a standalone implementation of the framework.

All analyses are fully configuration-driven. No parameters affecting results are hard-coded.

The full implementation of the framework is available in the **[epilink](https://github.com/ydnkka/epilink)** repository.
